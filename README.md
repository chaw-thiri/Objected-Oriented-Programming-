# Objected Oriented Programming👩‍💻
Date Created : 2023, Sept the 7th    
Languages : C++ 

## Features ✨
This repository provides solutions for all the lab sessions in Object Oriented Programming Course of INHA university's Integrated Systems Engineering Major.    
PDF files : questions with testcases     
CPP files : answers (and code explanation for the complex exercises)  

### How to use💡
Each lab focuses on specific topic, however complexity of each lab grow in ascending order.        

In each lab session, the most difficult and complex ones are indicated with a star emoji ⭐.    
If you are able to solve ⭐ exercise with no difficulty, congratulations 🎇, you are good to go! 
There is no need to review other problems in that lab.    
Move on to next lab. 

If you cannot solve ⭐ problems, try problems with no star first and come back later.    
If you are struggling to solve the problems without star, I highly advise you to revise the specific topic.

### Labs & Their Focus Topics
Lab2 : Dynamic memory allocation    
[Ex1 : searching in a dynamic array](https://github.com/chaw-thiri/Objected-Oriented-Programming-/blob/fcbd8bca325c6d28ec11d8e64e8deec22979d0b9/Lab02ex1.cpp)      
[Ex2 : addition of matrices using one dimentional dynamic arrays](https://github.com/chaw-thiri/Objected-Oriented-Programming-/blob/fcbd8bca325c6d28ec11d8e64e8deec22979d0b9/Lab02ex2.cpp)        
[Ex3⭐: multiplication of matrics using one dimentional dynamic arrays](https://github.com/chaw-thiri/Objected-Oriented-Programming-/blob/fcbd8bca325c6d28ec11d8e64e8deec22979d0b9/Lab02ex3.cpp)
